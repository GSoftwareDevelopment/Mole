# KRET - The Mole

Port of the game from PC to Atari 8-bit.

Arcade and logic game.

You play the role of Stefan the mole, who through his blindness ended up in a warehouse full of packages. Because of his clumsiness he has to be careful not to let the packages crush him.

The creators of the original are Andrzej Baka and Mariusz Buras. They wrote the game in 1991.

# RUN

To run, you will need the MAD Assember compiler and an ATARI emulator, or real hardware and software that allows you to load the compiled program.
